## Receiving Feedback & Recognition
- **I love feedback!** It helps me grow and learn from both my successes and failures/mistakes.
- **Positive Feedback**: I like private slack channel messages. If you want to give a shout out in other ways, please feel free to message me privately and ask for permission first.
- **Negative Feedback:** I prefer a private message with concrete examples and a respectful communication style. I'm very willing to hear constructive criticism and will do my best to resolve the issue.

## Work Patterns

- I currently work **standard business hours 9AM to 6PM Eastern Standard Time** (6AM to 3PM PST), but am flexible when needed.
- I prefer to work in groups when I need to solve harder problems, finish off difficult tasks, or want to increase creativity.
- I prefer to work alone when I am able to work at my own pace.
- My energy levels are best after my morning & afternoon coffee. I start to get a little drained by the end of the day, but will perk up with a hot cup of green tea.

## Communication Preferences

- I do my best to respond quickly to any messages via **Slack or Email** during business hours.
- For **urgent matters**, I frequently check my **Email** during non-working hours. I usually skim through emails to lightly check-in and make sure I'm not needed.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

- If I don't feel safe in a conversation, I will respectfully try to turn the conversation to something I'm more comfortable with or will politely exit the talk. If its something I feel I need to address afterwards, I will gently let you know privately.
- If I'm just not having an "on" or "good" day (i.e. I'm having a bad day), I will usually & unfortunately look it (haha)

### How to help

- Empathy and kindness go a long way for me! Please be patient and try to remember that I'm doing my best.
- A cup of green tea is always appreciated!
- If I need anything else, I will let you know on a case-by-case basis.

## Me Being Me

- My mind can go into research overdrive when I feel like a fish out of water, so please feel free to direct me towards any kind of documentation if I'm asking too many questions.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

- None :)
- If you're doing something that is **seriously** negatively affecting my ability to get things done, I will privately speak to you to open up a dialogue.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

- **Short Term Goals**: Use my skills to contribute meaningfully to my team, hone my coding skills, & learn a ton of new things along the way! Learning how to write cleaner code is what I'm currently working on.
- **Long Term Goals**: Improve my programming skills, communication skills, and efficiency rate for completing projects. I want to stay up to date on the latest technology... Hopefully someday get a promotion!

## Areas for Development

- I am still growing in my ability to maintain focus after reaching a certain level of feeling overwhelmed. I already have a few strategies, but any tips or tricks from others who also deal with this are welcome!
- Like many others, imposter syndrome can sometimes creep up on me.
